Supported features and limitations
***********************************

This topic summarizes the hipCIM features and limitations.

Features
---------

- **Core image interface (cucim.core):**

  - All primary image manipulation functions (read, write, and resample) are GPU-accelerated with CPU fallbacks.

  - Metadata operations (accessing dtype, dims, and shape) run on CPU only.

- **Image processing (cucim.skimage):**

  - Nearly all transform operations (resize, rotate, and warp) are GPU-accelerated with CPU fallbacks.

  - Complete filter suite (Gaussian, median, and edge detectors) benefits from GPU acceleration.

  - Most morphological operations (erosion, dilation, and opening) are GPU-accelerated.

- **Segmentation:**

  - Several advanced segmentation algorithms (felzenszwalb, quickshift, and active_contour) lack GPU acceleration.

  - Core segmentation operations such as watershed and SLIC are GPU-accelerated.

- **Color operations:**

  - All color space conversions (rgb2gray, rgb2hsv, and rgb2lab) are GPU-accelerated.

  - Specialized operations for medical imaging, such as stain separation or combination, also benefit from GPU acceleration.

- **Whole slide imaging:**

  - Patch extraction operations are GPU-accelerated.

  - Metadata operations run exclusively on the CPU.

- **Measurement functions:**

  - Core measurement functions like region labeling are GPU-accelerated.

  - Some advanced functions like ``marching_cubes`` lack GPU acceleration.

Image support
--------------

hipCIM supports the following image formats:

- Single-level Aperio ScanScope Virtual Slide (SVS) with JPEG compression

- Single-level Philips TIFF with JPEG compression

Note that the image support is limited by `rocJPEG chroma subsampling and hardware capabilities <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocJPEG/en/latest/reference/rocjpeg-formats-and-architectures.html>`_.

hipCIM API mirrors `scikit-image <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ for image manipulation and `OpenSlide <https://openslide.org/>`_ for image loading.

Limitations
------------

- No Support for JPEG2K compression.

- No GDS support

- No Dask support

- No support for the following image processing operations:

  - affine, similarity, euclidean, threshold_niblack, threshold_sauvola, convex_hull_image, corner_fast denoise_bilateral, denoise_wavelet, wiener, richardson_lucy, unsupervised_wiener, estimate_sigma, random_walker, felzenszwalb,slic, quickshift, watershed, active_contour, and all exposure operations.

- Registration:

  - All registration functions (optical flow and daemons) are GPU-accelerated but typically lack CPU fallbacks.

- Clara DL pipeline:

  - Data loading has partial GPU acceleration.

  - Most Clara transformations are GPU-accelerated with CPU fallbacks.

- Backend differences:

  - As hipCIM is an AMD ROCm port of cuCIM, it might differ from cuCIM in performance or numerical behavior. Validate results for mission-critical steps and `report reproducible issues <https://github.com/ROCm-LS/ROCm-LS-Docs/issues/new>`_.
